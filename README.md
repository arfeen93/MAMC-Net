# _CuMix_: Towards Recognizing Unseen Categories in Unseen Domains

This is the official PyTorch code of the method _CuMix_, introduced in our ECCV 2020 work 
["Towards Recognizing Unseen Categories in Unseen Domains"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.12256.pdf).

## Installation
This version has been tested on:
* PyTorch 1.5.1
* python 3.8.3
* cuda 10.2

To install all the dependencies, please run:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Zero-Shot Learning experiments
For setting up the datasets, please download CUB, AWA1, and SUN from 
[here](http://datasets.d2.mpi-inf.mpg.de/xian/xlsa17.zip) 
and FLO from [here](http://datasets.d2.mpi-inf.mpg.de/xian/cvpr18xian.zip) and unpack them. 
To download them, 
you can also use the script ```download_zsl.sh```:
```
./scripts/download_zsl.sh $ZSL_DESIRED_ROOT
```

For reproducing the results, just run the experiments given the corresponding dataset configuration. 
For instance, for CUB: 
```
python -m torch.distributed.launch --nproc_per_node=1 main.py --zsl --target cub --config_file configs/zsl/cub.json --data_root $ZSL_DESIRED_ROOT --name cub_exps_zsl
```
you can find other examples in ```scripts/zsl.sh```.

N.B. To simplify the release, this code does not include 
the validation procedure used to obtain the hyperparameters. In case you need to validate them, 
please DO NOT USE the unseen classes, but the splits given with the datasets.

## Domain Generalization experiments
For setting up the dataset, please download the official train/val/test splits of PACS from 
[here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B6x7gtvErXgfUU1WcGY5SzdwZVk), unpacking them. To download them, 
you can also use the script ```download_pacs.sh```:
```
./scripts/download_pacs.sh $PACS_DESIRED_ROOT
```

For reproducing the results, just run the experiments given the corresponding dataset configuration. 
For instance, for testing with _cartoon_ as target:  
```
python -m torch.distributed.launch --nproc_per_node=1 main.py --dg --target cartoon --config_file configs/dg/dg.json --data_root $PACS_DESIRED_ROOT --name cartoon_exps_dg
```
you can find other examples in ```scripts/dg.sh```. 

## ZSL+DG experiments
For setting up the datasets, please download DomainNet from 
[here](http://ai.bu.edu/M3SDA/), using the cleaned version. In the ```data``` folder, you can find the class splits 
(that we defined) and the embeddings used [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1077314220300928) . To download the data and set up the folder, 
you can also use the script ```download_dnet.sh```:
```
./scripts/download_dnet.sh $DNET_DESIRED_ROOT
```

For reproducing the results, just run the experiments given the corresponding dataset configuration.
For instance, for testing with _painting_ as target:  
```
python -m torch.distributed.launch --nproc_per_node=1 main.py --zsl --dg --target painting --config_file configs/zsl+dg/painting.json --data_root $DNET_DESIRED_ROOT --name painting_exps_zsldg
```
you can find other examples in ```scripts/zsldg.sh```.
